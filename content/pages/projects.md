### Dynamic Web Interaction Agent | [Link](https://github.com/ArunKumar0047/AI_Web_Agent/tree/main/v1)
*   Built an AI web agent using LangChain, LangGraph, and Selenium that autonomously interacts with Google Forms
by parsing user input and dynamically filling form fields.
*   Developed custom tools to enable seamless navigation, input handling, and form submission, leveraging OpenAI
models for intent extraction.
*   Delivered a working system that demonstrates how multi-agent workflows can automate repetitive tasks like form
filling, reducing manual effort and ensuring accurate data entry.
### Multi-Agent Resume Processing  | [Link](https://github.com/ArunKumar0047/Resume_Parser_Agent)
*   Developed a multi-agent workflow using LangGraph and LangChain to automate resume processing, which reads
multi-format files (PDF, DOCX), extracts key entities, and validates the data for accuracy.
*   Engineered a streamlined pipeline with distinct agents for reading, extracting, and validating resume information,
utilizing OpenAI models and a Streamlit UI for seamless user interaction and reliable data output.
*   Architected an automated resume analysis system by creating a graph-based workflow with agents that parse
various document types, extract crucial candidate information, and implement a validation step to ensure data
integrity.

### Personalized Movie Suggestions Platform | [Link](https://github.com/ArunKumar0047/ML_recommendation_system_and_webpage)
