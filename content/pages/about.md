As a recent graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through internships as a GenAI Intern and an AI and LLM Intern. I am particularly interested in building intelligent agents and creating
multi-agent workflows, with strong skills in turning data into actionable insights. I am eager to leverage my practical
experience to contribute to meaningful AI projects while continuing to learn and grow in a creative environment.
